You can’t be too sure of that which your eyes see. Not always are things what you think them to be. Is that music you see from a set of headphones? Or carolers singing melodious tones. Could this be the sight of a freshly lit match? Or maybe a marshmallow, starting to catch. Watch as we witness a nice ping-pong shot. Or maybe a dishwasher hanging a pot. So next time it seems like you’re in for a fall. You may find the drop is not nearly as tall. Sometimes it seems like you’re caught in a storm.
