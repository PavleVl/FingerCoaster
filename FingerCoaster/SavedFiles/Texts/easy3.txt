Why The Cricket Chirps. Before there were seasons, the cricket could fly. He flew faster than the bumblebee. He flew higher than the falcon. And he flew fancier than the flying duck who was quite a fancy flier. The cricket had flown all over the world. He flew to the East. Then he flew to the West. And then he flew to the South. But he had never flown North. The ant tried to warn him that he should not try. Itâ€™s very cold up north, said the Ant. Too cold for an ant and too cold for a cricket.
