Electron microscopic taking of an erythrocyte's membrane (plasma membrane). The membrane is seen as a double layer since electron dense material has been used for contrasting. It stains both the inner and the outer membrane's surface. The membrane is the area between the dark layers. Intracellular membranes separate compartments from each other. Some surround vacuoles, others mitochondria, chloroplasts and the nucleus. Compartments are reaction areas clearly separated spatially. All biological membranes have a great deal in common as regards organization and composition:They consist mainly of lipids and proteins. They act as a permeability barriers and are permeable only for selected substances.
