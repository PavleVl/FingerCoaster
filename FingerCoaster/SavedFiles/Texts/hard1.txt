The early studies of chromosomes, that have already been described, led to the discovery of mitosis and meiosis and the characterization of their different phases. The correspondence between the pattern of the chromosomal segregation and the genetic data indicated that chromosomes are the vehicles of the hereditary factors of genes. And still - the chromosome theory was, at the beginning of the 20th century, accepted only by few and was generally regarded rather sceptically. Its real breakthrough came with the recognition that the chromosomes of a genome are individual and differ from each other. The choice of a suitable model organism, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, proved to be decisive.
