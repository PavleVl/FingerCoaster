Phospholipids are the most common molecules in membranes. They consist of two parts, a hydrophilic (polar) head group (the phosphate group with the attached rest R) and a hydrophobic (lipophilic) fatty acid chain. This structure lends a tendency to form organized structures and monomolecular layers whose degree of organization is dependent on the length of the fatty acid residues and the number of double bonds to phospholipids. The Dutch Gorter and Grendel recognized in 1925 that two such layers of opposite orientations together would produce a fine membrane model. The hydrophobic parts of the molecule would point towards the inside of the double layer.
